## Horned Beasts

* This is a application that displays images and information of horned animals. This application will allow users to filter the images by number of horns and choose their favorite image.

* In addition to that I focused on the component structure of the application. During this application I used Vite and fill it with components.

### Feature 1: Display Images

* Given that a user wants to view the details of the image
When the user clicks on an individual image
Then the image should render larger on the screen with the description displayed.

#### Time Estimate

### Feature 2: Allow Users to Favorite Individual Beasts

* Given that a user wants to view specific images
When the user enters a character into the search field
Then only the images matching them.

 ### Time Estimate


### Feature 3: Bootstrap

* Given that a user opens the application in the browser
When the images are displayed on the screen
Then each image should be rendered in a visually pleasing way: in columns, as screen width allows.
