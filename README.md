## Horned Beasts

* This is an application that displays images and information of horned animals. This application will allow users to filter the images by the number of horns and can choose their favorite image. In addition to that I focused on the component structure of this  application and I used Vite with filled components.

### Feature 1: Display Images

* Given that a user wants to view the details of the image
When the user clicks on an individual image
Then the image should render larger on the screen with the description displayed.

### Feature 2: Allow Users To Select Their Favorite Beasts

* Given that a user wants to view specific images
When the user enters a character into the search field
Then only the images matching them.

### Feature 3: Bootstrap

* Given that a user opens the application in the browser
When the images are displayed on the screen
Then each image should be rendered in a visually pleasing way: in columns, as screen width allows.
