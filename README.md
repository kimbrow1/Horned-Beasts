### Feature #1: Display Images

* Given that a user opens the application in the browser
When the user navigates to the home page
Then the photo gallery should display all of the beasts' images in the gallery.

### Feature #2: Allow Users to Favorite Individual Beasts

* Given that a user opens the application in the browser
When a user clicks on an image of a beast
Then the number of "Favorites" displayed on that beast will increase by one.

### Feature 3: Bootstrap

* Given that a user opens the application in the browser
When the images are displayed on the screen
Then each image should be rendered in a visually pleasing way: in columns, as screen width allows.

### Stretch Goal: Add Interaction

* Given that a user opens the application in the browser
    When a user clicks on an item other than the horned beasts, such as the title of the page or the footer,
    Then the information and styles should change.
